**About me:**

I am a recent graduate from the Masters of Biomedical and Health Informatics program at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill seeking a Data Analyst position.

My coursework and experience have equipped me with programming skills and data analytics tools including:
  * SQL, SAS, and Python to extract and analyze information from databases and large data sets
  * Tableau and Observable Plot for data visualization
  * HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for web development

I hope to use this page to showcase my projects and demonstrate these skills.
